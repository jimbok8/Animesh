Construct from a Graph

In addition to basi cgraph operations it has an up and down layer

We should be able to call build_hierarchy( Graph ) and get a HieraarchicalGraph back

build_hierarchy should iterate over the graph finding pairs of neighbours and replace each pair with a new node, connected to all the old nodes



o----o----o--o
     |      /
     |     /
     o----o

The term for this is edge contraction where an edge is removed and a new vertex formed from the formed end points of that edge

We need to do two things; 
* Ensure we hit each edge in the graph
* Ensure we hit each edge only ONCE
* Ensure that all new nodes are at the same level
* Maintain pointers to the two nodes in the original graph which were collapsed

So the new node must maintain
* Old node1 pointer
* Old node2 pointer
* Graph hierarch level
* Merged data from nodes 1 and 2



Get list of all nodes
Create emty set of visited nodes
If there are more nodes in the list
	Take next node in list
	If this node not in visited nodes
		If there are edges left
			Get node for next edge
			If this node is not in visited set
				Create new Node
				Set data as merge of sourc nodes
				Set node 1 pointer and node 2 pointer 
				For each neighbour of node 1
					If neighbour is visited
						Create edge from new node to neighbours new node
					Else
						Create edge from new node to neighbour
					End
				End
				For each neighbour of node 1
					If neighbour is visited
						Create edge from new node to neighbours new node
					Else
						Create edge from new node to neighbour
					End
				End
			End
		End
		Add this node to visited nodes
	End
End
