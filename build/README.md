# MLE002 Master

This branch is the main branch for Milestone 2; applying the orientation field to disparate point clouds.

The main activities will be:

Build a preprocessing step which loads disparate point clouds and places them into correspondence
Do the first thing while also constructing a graph of vertices for the orientation field
And also computing deformations between nodes across frames.

Then apply the orientation field construction.
