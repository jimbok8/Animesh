Check for use of computing correspondence groups as paths
Each point in a frame refers forward to a single point. We track this to tghe end of the build but we explicitly do not merge clusters.

We should
1. Measure the relative difference in surfels for each frame
2. Check the value of each path as a surfel. Is it good?
